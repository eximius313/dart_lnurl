# API Reference

`Future<LNURLParseResult> getParams(String encodedUrl)`
Use this to parse an encoded bech32 lnurl string or raw (non bech32-encoded) URLs, call the URI, and return the parsed response from the lnurl service. The `encodedUrl` can either have `lightning:` in it or not.

`String decryptSuccessActionAesPayload({LNURLPaySuccessAction successAction, String preimage})`

When doing lnurl pay, the success action could contain an encrypted payload using the payment preimage. Use this function to decrypt that payload.
